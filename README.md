_"A curated list of useful resources in Remote Sensing / Earth Observation"_


With the increasing amount and availability of satellite Earth Observation data itâ€™s critical to know where to search for it and what suits best for the task at hands. So to help with this I decided to create a minimal list with different types of resources in RS/EO (mostly focusing on optical sensors). In this page, itâ€™s possible to find data sources, learning materials, software and processing platforms among other potentially useful stuff. (Almost) everything in this directory is alphabetically listed so I am not organizing things according to my taste or preferences ðŸ˜‰

Check it out here: [link](http://joaogoncalves.cc/Remote-Sensing-Earth-Observation-directory)

I am certain that important resources or references are missing so let me know if you have suggestions to include here.
